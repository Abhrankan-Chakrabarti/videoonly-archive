# VideoOnly

**VideoOnly** is a Tor-only, read-only anonymous confession archive.

There are no accounts, no tracking, no analytics, no JavaScript, and no web forms.
This project is intentionally minimal by design.

## What this is

VideoOnly exists to provide a quiet place for people to share things they cannot say elsewhere.

- Confessions are submitted privately
- Publication is selective
- Not all submissions are published
- Published content may be lightly edited for clarity, never for meaning

This is not social media.
There are no comments, reactions, or engagement metrics.

## How submissions work

Confessions are **not** submitted through the website.

All submissions are sent privately using **end-to-end encrypted email (PGP)**.
Only encrypted messages are accepted.
Unencrypted messages may be ignored.

Submission instructions, public PGP key, and encryption guidance are available on the site.

---

## Access

VideoOnly is accessible **only via the Tor Network**.

Homepage (Tor Browser required):

## Anonymity and limitations

VideoOnly minimizes data collection, but no system can offer absolute anonymity.

- No client-side scripts are used
- No user accounts exist
- No analytics or trackers are present
- Server-side logging is kept to the minimum required for operation

Users are responsible for their own operational security.
Read the submission guidelines carefully before sending anything.

## Status

This project is intentionally small.
Growth is not a goal.
Longevity and clarity are.

If you are here only to read, that is fine.
If you choose to submit, take your time and encrypt before sending.
